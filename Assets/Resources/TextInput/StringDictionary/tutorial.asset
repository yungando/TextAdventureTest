  text: "The game uses a \"console command\"-like input system to communicate with
    the player. Type commands in the input field, press enter to execute and the game
    will respond in the log. The log's text animation can be skipped at any time by
    pressing ESC or Left Mouse. The white bar on the right hand side of the screen
    is a standard Scroll Bar. This can be used to go back and read previous commands
    and responses. The Mouse's Scroll Wheel does the same.\n\nThis is a Resource Management
    game, akin to \"Cookie-Clicker\" but for settlement Resources such as Wood, Fish,
    Wheat and Coal. The goal is to accumulate as much Gold as possible by collecting
    and selling supplies of these Resources. There is a balance to strike between
    saving Gold and spending it to unlock new Resources and Upgrades to increase your
    collecting efficiency.\n\nOnce a Resource is unlocked it will be automatically
    collected over time, increasing your supply until it reaches it's supply capacity.
    To continue collecting a Resource once it's reached it's capacity, the current
    supply must be manually sold.\n\nEach Resource has unique stats for the following:\n\n\tHow
    long it takes to collect\n\tHow much is collected each cycle\n\tHow much you can
    store\n\tThe Gold value\n\nUpgrades will positively effect these stats in some
    way, increasing your efficiency in collecting and selling the Resources. Upgrades
    become available to unlock once you have unlocked the Resource it applies to.
    You can't unlock an upgrade for Coal if you aren't collecting it.\n\nGameplay
    Events will happen regularly throughout the gameplay and will effect the same
    stats as Upgrades. The events will try and respond to your actions with each one
    doing something different; Their effects won't always be positive. When an event
    is triggered, a message will show up in game describing the event and its effects,
    as well as displaying the event's name in green.\n\nThere are five main commands
    used in gameplay: List, Unlock, Info, Check and Sell. To find out how these work,
    add the name of the command to the help command input:\n\n\t> help list\n\t> help
    unlock\n\t> help info\n\t> help check\n\t> help sell\n\nIf you read through the
    information in the help commands above and are still stuck, give the following
    command a read on how to start playing:\n\n\t> help quick guide\n\nFor a list
    of all available commands, type:\n\n\t> help"
