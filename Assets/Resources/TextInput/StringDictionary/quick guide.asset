  text: "To begin, you'll need to unlock your first Resource. To see what is available,
    use the command:\n\n\t> list\n\nHere you will see the available Resources, and
    once a Resource is unlocked, here is where you will see it's available Upgrades.
    You start the game with 100 Gold, enough to unlock the first available Resource,
    Wood. To confirm you have enough Gold, use the command:\n\n\t> check gold\n\nUnlocking
    a Resource will start it collecting automatically until it reaches it's supply
    capacity. Wood's starting supply capacity is 100. To unlock Wood, use the command:\n\n\t>
    unlock wood\n\nOnce Wood reaches it's supply capacity, you'll need to sell it
    so you can collect more. To sell Wood for it's default Gold value, use the command:\n\n\t>
    sell wood\n\nNow that Wood is unlocked and collecting, the Events will start to
    effect your gameplay so watch out for them. After your first sale of a complete
    supply of Wood, you will have 50 Gold. Sell one more full supply of Wood and you
    should have enough to unlock your first Wood Upgrade. You could also save up and
    instead unlock another Resource to collect. To see what's available, use the command:\n\n\t>
    list\n\nIf you see an Upgrade or Resource you would like more information on,
    use the info command. The first available Upgrade for Wood is Log Sacks, so lets
    find out more about that upgrade by using the command:\n\n\t> info log sacks\n\nThis
    should cover the full gameplay loop, so you should be ready to play."
